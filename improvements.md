Implementation Plan for KPP Presentation
 Website Improvements
 Overview:
 This plan outlines a step-by-step approach to upgrading the KPP presentation website using Next.js. It
 focuses on front-end enhancements – modernizing the tech stack, improving design consistency across all
 pages, and ensuring a professional, responsive user interface. We will integrate MDX for interactive content,
 implement a cohesive design system, add interactive visualizations, and follow best practices for
 accessibility, performance, and deployment. Each step includes detailed instructions and code snippets to
 guide the web developer through implementation.
 Step 1: Initialize the Next.js Project
 Begin by setting up a Next.js application as the foundation. Using the Next.js CLI (
 create-next-app ) will
 scaffold a project with the recommended structure: pages, public assets, and configuration files . For
 example, run the following in your terminal (replace 
my-project with your project name):
 npx create-next-app@latest my-project
 cd my-project
 git init && git add . && git commit-m "Initial Next.js app"
 1
 This creates a baseline Next.js app with a default homepage in 
pages/index.js . Next.js provides a
 robust framework for building both static and interactive content, which is ideal for the KPP presentation
 site. The default project structure includes: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
pages/ : Holds page components (each file maps to a route). We will use this for static pages and
 slide content. 
public/ : Assets like images/videos go here for direct serving. 
styles/ : Global stylesheet or CSS modules for styling. 
components/ : (Create this folder) for reusable UI components (e.g., navigation bar, slide layout,
 charts). Organizing components promotes reuse and cleaner code.
 Next.js supports both a Pages Router (file-based routing under 
pages/ ) and the newer App Router. For
 simplicity, we will use the Pages Router, treating each main section or slide as a page. This yields
 straightforward URLs and lets us leverage MDX pages (Markdown/JSX hybrid) for slide content.
 1
Step 2: Enable MDX for Interactive Content
 MDX (Markdown combined with JSX) will allow us to write presentation content in Markdown while
 embedding React components for interactivity. By default, Next.js doesn’t support MDX, so we need to
 install and configure it. Install the MDX packages in the project:
 npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @types/mdx
 Next, enable MDX in Next.js by updating 
next.config.js . We will use 
f
 iles into React pages. Add MDX support and include 
.mdx in the page extensions:
 // next.config.js
 import createMDX from '@next/mdx';
 @next/mdx to transform 
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
 const nextConfig = {
 pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'ts', 'tsx', 'md', 'mdx'], // recognize MDX 
pages
 // ...other Next.js config
 };
 export default createMDX()(nextConfig); // Enable MDX transformation
 In the above config, we added 
'mdx' to 
pageExtensions so Next.js treats 
2
 .mdx
 .mdx files in the pages
 directory as routable pages, and we wrapped the config with the MDX plugin to handle MDX compilation
 . Now our app can render MDX files as if they were normal Next pages.
 Step 3: Create Presentation Pages with MDX and Slide Layout
 With MDX enabled, we can author each slide or section of the presentation as an 
.mdx page. This lets
 content authors write in Markdown for simplicity, while still allowing React components (for charts, etc.) to
 be embedded. We recommend creating a clear structure for these pages, for example a subdirectory
 pages/slides/ or simply distinct pages for major sections. Each MDX file represents a slide or section of
 the presentation.
 Naming convention: Use numeric or descriptive filenames. For instance, 
introduction.mdx , 
pages/slides/1
2-technology.mdx , etc., corresponding to the presentation order. Each MDX page
 can optionally export metadata (frontmatter) at the top. For example, in 
1-introduction.mdx we might
 include:
 export const meta = { title: "Introduction" };
 # Welcome to the KPP Presentation
 2
This **Next.js + MDX** powered slideshow allows mixing text, images, and React 
components.  - Built with Next.js for a fast, modern experience  - Write slides in Markdown for ease of editing  - **Interactive**: embed React components (charts, etc.) directly in slides  
The above shows a Markdown heading and list for content. We also exported a 
meta.title which we can
 use for the page 
<title> if needed. Writing content in MDX keeps it human-readable and easy to update,
 while still enabling dynamic elements.
 Consistent Slide Layout: To maintain a coherent style across slides, create a reusable layout component
 (e.g., 
components/SlideLayout.js ). This component will wrap slide content and provide common
 styling (like centering) and navigation controls (Next/Previous buttons) for stepping through slides. For
 example:
 // components/SlideLayout.js
 import Link from 'next/link';
 export default function SlideLayout({ children, prevHref = null, nextHref =
 null, title = "" }) {
 return (
 <div className="slide-container">
 <div className="slide-content">
 {title && <h1>{title}</h1>}
 {children}
 </div>
 {/* Navigation controls */}
 <div className="slide-nav">
 {prevHref && <Link href={prevHref} className="nav-btn">← Previous</
 Link>}
 {nextHref && <Link href={nextHref} className="nav-btn">Next →</Link>}
 </div>
 </div>
 );
 }
 This 
SlideLayout uses a container (
 .slide-container ) that covers the full viewport and centers its
 content. It optionally displays a title and wraps the slide text (
 children ). At the bottom, it renders
 "Previous" and "Next" links if URLs are provided via props. We will style these classes in CSS later. 
Now, use 
SlideLayout in each MDX page to apply the layout and navigation. For example, in the first
 slide (
 1-introduction.mdx ), import the layout and wrap the content:
 3
import SlideLayout from '../components/SlideLayout.js';
 <SlideLayout nextHref="/slides/2-technology" title="Introduction to KPP 
Technology">
  ## Welcome to KPP Technology  
  The Kinetic Power Plant (KPP) is a groundbreaking renewable energy solution 
developed by Deep Engineering GmbH...
 *(slide content continues…)*
 </SlideLayout>
 Similarly, slide 2 can import 
SlideLayout and use 
maybe 
3
 prevHref="/slides/1-introduction" and
 nextHref="/slides/3-..." to link neighboring slides. This creates seamless navigation
 between slides as separate pages . It also ensures each slide page has a consistent structure (title,
 content area, nav controls), reinforcing a coherent style.
 Step 4: Implement a Global Navigation Bar and Footer
 For a more professional, website-like presentation, include a persistent navigation bar (header) and footer
 on all pages. This allows users to jump to different sections (Home, Technology, Performance, Contact, etc.)
 easily, and gives the site a polished feel. In Next.js (using the Pages Router), one way to do this is to create a
 custom App component (
 pages/_app.js ) that wraps every page. 
Navigation Bar: Develop a 
<NavBar> component (e.g., in 
components/NavBar.js ) that contains the
 company logo and a menu of links to key pages or slide sections. Ensure the NavBar is responsive (e.g., a
 collapsible menu on mobile) and accessible. For instance, use semantic 
and 
<nav> tags with 
aria-label ,
 <button> for toggling mobile menu, etc. Include visual cues for the active page. In our project, we
 define an array of 
navItems (label and href for each) and map them to 
<li> elements containing
 <Link> s. We also handle a mobile menu open state with a hamburger button. Here’s a simplified excerpt:
 // components/NavBar.js (excerpt)
 <nav className={`professional-navbar ${hasScrolled ? 'scrolled' : ''}`}
 role="navigation" aria-label="Main navigation">
 <div className="navbar-container">
 {/* Logo / Brand */}
 <Link href="/" aria-label="Deep Engineering - Home">
 <img src="/images/deep-engineering-logo.png" alt="Deep Engineering Logo"
 className="logo-image" />
 </Link>
 {/* Menu Items */}
 <ul className={`navbar-links ${isMobileMenuOpen ? 'open' : ''}`} id="main
navigation">
 {navItems.map(item => (
 <li key={item.href}>
 4
<Link href={item.href} className={`nav-link ${router.pathname ===
 item.href ? 'active' : ''}`}>
 {item.label}
 </Link>
 </li>
 ))}
 </ul>
 {/* Mobile Menu Toggle Button */}
 <button className="mobile-menu-toggle" onClick={() => setIsMobileMenuOpen(!
 isMobileMenuOpen)} aria-label="Toggle navigation">
 <span></span><span></span><span></span>
 </button>
 </div>
 </nav>
 This NavBar will appear at the top of every page. We use CSS (discussed later) to style it (e.g., a semi
transparent backdrop that becomes solid on scroll, horizontal link list that turns into a hamburger menu on
 small screens).
 Footer: Similarly, create a 
<Footer> component or define footer content in 
_app.js . The footer can
 include company information, links, and contact info. We want the footer style to match the site (e.g., light
 background, small text, links for privacy, etc.).
 Include in App Layout: Once NavBar and Footer are ready, include them in the app’s layout. In Next.js
 Pages Router, you can add them in 
pages/_app.js around the 
<Component /> . For example, our
 _app.js looks like:
 // pages/_app.js
 import '../styles/globals.css';
 import NavBar from '../components/NavBar';
 function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
 return (
 <div className="app-container">
 <NavBar />
 {/* header on all pages */}
 <main className="main-content">
 <Component {...pageProps} />
 </main>
 {/* ... footer can be included here ... */}
 </div>
 );
 }
 export default MyApp;
 5
By wrapping the rendered page (
 4
 Component ) with NavBar and footer, we ensure consistent navigation
 and branding across all pages . Now, whether the user is on the home page or a deep slide, they will see
 the same top navigation and bottom footer, providing a coherent experience.
 Accessibility Tip: Include a “skip to main content” link at the top (in NavBar or _app) for screen reader and
 keyboard users to bypass navigation. For instance: 
<a href="#main-content" className="skip
5
 link">Skip to main content</a> at the very top of the DOM. We have added such an anchor in our
 pages for accessibility .
 Step 5: Add Interactive Charts for Data Visualization
 To make the presentation engaging and informative, integrate an interactive chart for visualizing data (e.g.,
 performance metrics). We can use a React chart library like Recharts (based on D3.js) for this purpose .
 Recharts offers premade components for charts and works well with React. (Alternatively, one could use
 Chart.js via a React wrapper like 
react-chartjs-2 – integration steps would be similar.)
 Install a chart library: For example, to use Recharts, install it with: 
npm install recharts
 Create a Chart Component: Make a reusable React component for the chart, say 
6
 PerformanceChart.js . In this component, we define the chart using Recharts components (LineChart,
 XAxis, YAxis, Tooltip, etc.) and provide it with data. For example:
 // components/PerformanceChart.js
 import { LineChart, Line, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, Legend } from
 'recharts';
 const data = [
 { name: 'Jan', output: 50, efficiency: 75 },
 { name: 'Feb', output: 60, efficiency: 80 },
 { name: 'Mar', output: 55, efficiency: 78 },
 // ... (sample data points)
 ];
 components/
 export default function PerformanceChart() {
 return (
 <LineChart width={600} height={300} data={data}>
 <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" />
 <XAxis dataKey="name" />
 <YAxis yAxisId="left" label={{ value: 'Output (kW)', angle:-90,
 position: 'insideLeft' }} />
 <YAxis yAxisId="right" orientation="right" label={{ value: 'Efficiency 
(%)', angle: 90, position: 'insideRight' }} />
 <Tooltip />
 6
<Legend />
 <Line yAxisId="left" type="monotone" dataKey="output" stroke="#8884d8"
 activeDot={{ r: 8 }} />
 <Line yAxisId="right" type="monotone" dataKey="efficiency"
 stroke="#82ca9d" />
 </LineChart>
 );
 }
 In this snippet, we create a dual-axis line chart plotting Output and Efficiency by month. The chart is
 600×300px, has grid lines, and interactive tooltip/legend. The data is a static array here for example
 purposes – this could be fetched or passed in as props if needed. The key is that this is a normal React
 component, which we can test and render independently.
 Embed Chart in MDX: MDX allows importing React components into your markdown. On any slide/page
 where a chart is needed, import the chart component at the top and then use it like a JSX tag in the content.
 For example, in an MDX slide for performance data:
 import SlideLayout from '../components/SlideLayout.js';
 import PerformanceChart from '../components/PerformanceChart.js';
 <SlideLayout prevHref="/slides/previous" nextHref="/slides/next" 
title="Performance Analysis">
  <PerformanceChart />
  ## KPP Performance Q1  
  The chart below illustrates the KPP’s output and efficiency over the first 
quarter. Hover over points to see exact values:
 </SlideLayout>
 When this page renders, the 
7
 <PerformanceChart /> component will display the interactive chart (e.g.,
 lines that you can hover for tooltips) right inside the slide . This demonstrates how we mix static content
 (headings, text) with dynamic visuals in MDX. If you prefer a different library (like Chart.js), you would create
 a similar React component for the chart and embed it in the same way – the approach doesn’t change.
 Performance Tip: Next.js will automatically code-split, meaning the chart library code will only be loaded on
 the page that includes 
PerformanceChart . This avoids bloating the initial bundle for pages that don’t
 need the chart. For extra optimization, you could dynamically import the chart component only on the client
 side if it’s very heavy or not compatible with SSR. For example, using 
next/dynamic with 
8
 ssr: false
 to load the chart component only in the browser can reduce server-render overhead for complex visuals
 . However, Recharts works with SSR by default, so dynamic import is optional.
 7
Step 6: Embed Images and Videos Optimally
 The KPP presentation likely includes diagrams, photos, or video clips. We need to incorporate these media
 assets in a performant way while maintaining quality.
 Images: Next.js provides an optimized 
<Image> component for handling images. Using 
next/image is
 highly recommended, as it automatically generates responsive versions, serves images in modern
 formats (like WebP), and lazy-loads them by default . To use it, import 
9
 and reference images from the 
Image from 
'next/image'
 public/ folder or remote sources. For each image, provide 
width and
 height (or use layout="responsive") and an informative 
alt text for accessibility. For example:
 import Image from 'next/image';
 /* ...inside a component/MDX... */
 <Image
 src="/images/revenue-breakdown.png"
 alt="Revenue breakdown diagram showing various sources of income"
 width={800}
 height={600}
 priority
 />
 In this snippet, the image file is placed in 
public/images/revenue-breakdown.png . We specify
 dimensions which helps Next.js reserve space and serve appropriately sized images. We also mark it as
 priority if it’s critical (e.g., an above-the-fold hero image) so it loads immediately. The Next.js Image
 component will handle converting it to WebP/AVIF for modern browsers and only loading the image when it
 is close to entering the viewport .
 10
 9
 Videos: For video content, place video files under 
You can use the standard HTML5 
public/videos/ (or use external video links/embeds).
 <video> tag to embed a video. For example, to include a local MP4
 video in a slide:
 <video src="/videos/launch-demo.mp4" width="800" controls muted>
  Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
 </video>
 This will show a video player with controls. In the code above, we also provided a fallback text for older
 browsers. The 
muted attribute can allow auto-play in some browsers if needed (and is good for
 background loops). If the video is hosted on YouTube or Vimeo, you could embed via an 
instead.
 By copying all relevant images and videos from the original presentation into the 
<iframe>
 public directory and
 using these methods, we preserve the visual content. Remember to add descriptive 
alt text for
 images (Next.js will warn if you omit alt text, as this is important for accessibility ). For video, consider
 11
 8
providing captions or a text summary on the page for users who can’t hear audio, to meet accessibility
 guidelines.
 Step 7: Apply Responsive Design and Cohesive Styling
 To ensure a professional look, the site must have a unified design language and be responsive to various
 screen sizes. This step involves setting up global styles (or a theme) and making sure all pages use
 consistent colors, typography, and spacing.
 Global Style Theme: Define a global CSS (e.g., 
styles/globals.css ) with custom CSS variables for
 colors, fonts, etc., so that the entire site references the same palette and typography. For example, we
 created a light theme in 
:root with variables for primary color, background, text color, etc.:
 /* styles/globals.css */
 :root {--color-primary: #2A57A5;--color-primary-hover: #23498E;--color-background: #FAFAFA;--color-surface: #FFFFFF;--color-text: #1E293B;--color-text-secondary: #475569;
 /* ...other colors like accent, border, etc... */--font-primary: 'Inter', sans-serif;--font-mono: 'JetBrains Mono', monospace;
 /* ...spacing and radius variables... */
 }
 html, body {
 margin: 0; padding: 0;
 font-family: var(--font-primary);
 background: var(--color-background);
 color: var(--color-text);
 line-height: 1.6;
 }
 * { box-sizing: border-box; }
 12
 13
 In the above snippet, we set a primary brand color (deep blue), background whites/grays, text colors, and
 imported web fonts for a modern look . These variables can be used throughout our CSS (including
 in styled JSX in components) to ensure consistent colors and spacing. By using CSS custom properties, if we
 ever want to adjust the theme (e.g. switch to dark mode or tweak brand colors), it’s one centralized change.
 Page and Component Styles: We want all pages to feel like part of the same site. Reuse CSS classes and
 patterns where possible. For example, we have multiple pages that start with a hero section
 (.hero-title, 
.hero-subtitle classes) and use card grids. Ensure that the styling for these repeated
 patterns is defined once (perhaps globally or in a shared CSS module) so that "Summary", "Technology",
 etc., pages all use the same font sizes and margins for headings, the same background style for cards, etc.
 9
This avoids one page looking different from another. In our code, we applied consistent classes like
 .section-title for all section headings, 
.card styles for feature cards, and so on, defined in either
 global CSS or each page’s CSS. For example, a section title class:
 .section-title {
 font-size: 2.5rem;
 font-weight: 700;
 text-align: center;
 margin: 0 0 3rem;
 color: var(--color-text);
 }
 By using the same 
.section-title class on all pages’ 
<h2> elements, we guarantee uniform styling
 (same size, color, spacing) for all section headings. Do similar for other common elements (paragraph text,
 buttons, card containers). This yields a coherent style across pages, enhancing the professional feel.
 Responsive Design: Use flexible layouts (CSS Grid/Flexbox) and relative units so that the site works on
 desktops, tablets, and phones. For instance, we use CSS grid with 
auto-fit or 
14
 layouts wrap on smaller screens . Text sizes can use 
15
 auto-fill to make card
 clamp() or responsive units. In CSS, media
 queries can adjust styles for smaller widths (e.g., reducing padding on sections for mobile). Ensure that
 images and videos are set to 
max-width: 100% so they shrink on small screens and don’t overflow. Our
 styles already include many of these responsive practices (e.g., the 
.component-grid uses
 minmax(250px, 1fr) so at least one card fits nicely on narrow screens) .
 16
 As an example, here’s how we made a grid of feature cards adapt:
 .features-grid {
 display: grid;
 grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
 gap: 2rem;
 }
 This will automatically use more columns if space allows, or fewer columns (down to one) on a small device,
 ensuring cards are not squished. Test each page in a mobile view to adjust any layout that doesn’t naturally
 stack.
 UI Frameworks (Optional): For an even more consistent and quick design, you might consider integrating
 a CSS framework or component library. For example, Tailwind CSS can provide utility classes for a
 consistent spacing scale and responsive design out-of-the-box, and libraries like Chakra UI or Material UI
 offer pre-styled components that ensure a polished look. In our case, we stuck with custom CSS for fine
grained control and because we already had a design in mind . But if starting from scratch on styling, a
 design system or framework can enforce consistency (common color themes, typography, etc.) and speed
 up development. For instance, Tailwind ensures you use the same spacing increments everywhere, which
 17
 10
naturally maintains coherence in design. If you choose to integrate such a library, follow their setup guide
 (often just an 
npm install and some configuration). 
In summary, by defining global styles (colors, fonts) and reusing CSS patterns across pages, we maintain a
 coherent style throughout the site. All pages should feel like parts of the same product, with consistent
 branding and UI elements.
 Step 8: Incorporate Accessibility Best Practices
 An accessible website is a mark of a professional product. We should ensure that our improvements don’t
 just look good, but can be used by people with disabilities and meet standards (like WCAG). Next.js helps by
 including some accessibility linters and best practices by default, but we must intentionally implement
 many aspects:
 • 
Semantic HTML: Use proper semantic tags for structure. In slides MDX, for example, use 
main titles, 
## for section headings, 
<p> for paragraphs, 
styling non-semantic tags. We have been doing this in our content (e.g., using 
# for
 <ul> for lists, etc., rather than just
 <h2> for section
 titles, which gives structure to screen readers and SEO). Also use landmarks: our NavBar is a 
<nav>
 with 
aria-label , our content is inside 
<main id="main-content"> for clarity , and the
 footer is a 
<footer> .
 • 
Alt Text for Images: Every 
<Image> requires an 
18
 alt attribute describing the image. This is not
 only enforced by Next.js linting, but crucial for visually impaired users using screen readers . We
 have written meaningful alt text for each image (e.g., describing what a diagram shows, rather than
 just "diagram").
 11
 • 
• 
• 
Keyboard Navigation: Ensure interactive elements (links, buttons) are reachable and usable via
 keyboard. In our NavBar, the mobile menu button can be focused and activated by pressing Enter
 (it’s a real 
19
 20
 <button> ). We also added focus styles (outlines) in CSS so that when a link or button is
 focused, it’s clearly highlighted . The Skip link (mentioned earlier) appears when focused,
 letting users jump to content. Test that you can tab through the page: the order should make sense
 (NavBar links, then skip link, then main content links, etc.).
 ARIA labels and roles: Use ARIA attributes when needed. We included 
aria-label on nav and
 the mobile toggle button to announce their purpose. In slide navigation, the Next/Prev links are just
 links with text (so they’re fine). If any icon buttons exist, they should have 
aria-label or screen
reader text. Also ensure proper roles (e.g., the list of slides or menu items could use
 role="menubar" and 
role="menuitem" , though using semantic 
sufficient).
 <ul><li> is typically
 Headings and Page Titles: Each page/slide should have a clear heading (we use an 
h1 or h2 at
 the top of each slide via the 
SlideLayout title or the first Markdown heading). Additionally, set the
 HTML 
<title> tag for each page to reflect the content. In Next.js, you do this by using the
 <Head> 
component from 
next/head 
pages/technology.js you might include: 
inside 
each page. For example, in
 <Head><title>KPP – Technology Details</
 title></Head> . This ensures that when navigating, screen reader users hear the new page title
 11
announced, and it also improves SEO. Because we exported 
meta.title in MDX slides, we could
 use that to set the title dynamically in 
SlideLayout or in each page’s 
<Head> .
 • 
21
 Testing: Use tools like Lighthouse or axe to test accessibility. Next.js’s development mode will also
 warn about common issues (e.g., it will log a warning if an image is missing alt text or if links lack
 href ). Address any issues these tools point out.
 22
 By following these practices, we ensure our site is usable for all users. For instance, providing alt text and
 using proper contrast colors not only avoids linter warnings but makes the content understandable to
 screen reader users . Our improvements like adding the skip link, focusing outlines, and semantic
 headings all contribute to meeting accessibility standards.
 Step 9: Optimize Performance and SEO
 Next.js is inherently optimized in many ways, but we should still be mindful of performance and search
friendliness as we implement changes.
 • 
Code Splitting & Lazy Loading: As mentioned, Next.js will split the code by page. This means users
 only download the JS needed for the page they’re viewing, improving load times . To further
 optimize, use dynamic imports for modules that are not needed initially. We already considered
 using 
23
 next/dynamic for the chart component if necessary. Also, Next.js automatically lazy-loads
 images via the 
<Image> component and any offscreen scripts or components by default. This
 yields a good performance baseline.
 • 
• 
• 
• 
Minification & Bundling: Ensure you build for production (
 next build ) which enables SWC
 minification of JS/CSS. This is usually default in Next.js apps . Also, keep React in Strict Mode (the
 default) for best practices and potential performance benefits.
 24
 Asset Optimization: We used Next.js Image for pictures (which compresses and serves responsive
 sizes) and we are self-hosting video efficiently. Avoid very large images; resize or compress them if
 needed before putting in 
public/ . For any custom fonts, use Next.js font optimization or a CDN to
 load them quickly.
 SEO Considerations: Each page should have a unique title and meta description. For example, our
 home page’s 
25
 <Head> includes a meta description describing the KPP technology . Add similar
 descriptions for other pages (e.g., Technology page, Performance page) highlighting their content.
 Use heading tags in a logical hierarchy (we do: one 
h1 or h2 per page as main title, then sub
sections with 
h3 , etc.). This structure helps search engines understand the content. Additionally,
 ensure URLs are meaningful (our use of pages like 
/technology , 
/performance are SEO
friendly and descriptive).
 Testing Performance: After implementing, run Lighthouse (in Chrome DevTools or using 
npm run 
next build && next start and an online tool) to check performance scores. Lighthouse will flag
 things like large bundle sizes, render-blocking resources, or unoptimized images. Given our use of
 Next.js features, we expect a high score. For example, using Next.js’s Image component
 automatically gave one developer’s site better Lighthouse performance thanks to lazy loading and
 12
9
 modern formats . If Lighthouse flags anything (e.g., unused CSS or too-large JavaScript), consider
 code-splitting further or removing dependencies.
 • 
26
 27
 Caching and Deployment Performance: When we deploy on Vercel (next step), we automatically
 benefit from their CDN caching of static assets . Vercel will also handle compressing
 responses (gzip/brotli) and other optimizations. We don’t have to do much here, but just be aware
 that deploying on a platform like Vercel or Netlify brings performance perks out-of-the-box (global
 edge servers, etc.).
 By relying on Next.js’s optimizations (like image optimization, static generation for our mostly static content,
 and built-in code splitting), we achieve good performance without extensive manual tuning . As a
 rule, we will continue to monitor performance as we add features – for instance, if we add a very heavy
 third-party script, we’d load it asynchronously or on demand.
 Step 10: Deploy the Site on Vercel
 23
 27
 Once development and testing are complete, we will deploy the presentation website for easy sharing.
 Vercel is an ideal host for Next.js applications (it’s the platform created by the Next.js team). It provides
 seamless integration: push your code to a Git repository, and Vercel can auto-build and deploy it, with
 global CDN distribution.
 Deployment Steps:
 1. Push to GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket): Make sure all your code, including the Next.js project and all
 content, is in a git repository. If using GitHub, you can keep it private or public. Commit all changes and
 push to the main branch.
 2. Connect to Vercel: Create a Vercel account (if you haven’t) and use the “Import Project” feature. Select
 your repository. Vercel will detect it’s a Next.js app and suggest default settings.
 3. Configure (if needed): Typically, no configuration is needed for Next.js. Vercel will install dependencies
 and run 
npm run build automatically. Ensure the build command and output folder (Next.js defaults)
 are correct – Vercel knows to use 
.next/ build output.
 4. Deploy: Click deploy and wait a minute or two. Vercel will build the project in the cloud and deploy it.
 You’ll get a live URL like 
28
 (Optional)
 https://my-project.vercel.app once done . 5. Test Production: Open
 the deployed URL and click through the site. Verify that all images load (they will be served from Vercel’s
 optimized image CDN), videos play, and interactive charts function. Also test on a mobile device if possible.
 6. 
Custom Domain: If this presentation needs a custom domain (e.g.,
 presentation.deepengineering.com ), you can configure that in Vercel by adding a domain and
 updating DNS records. Not necessary for internal or demo purposes, but good for a production release.
 Vercel provides preview deployments for each Git push, which is great for development – every time we
 push an update, we can get a unique preview URL to share/test before promoting to production. Because
 our site is primarily static content (no server-side code), it will be very fast on Vercel’s global CDN and can
 handle traffic with ease .

 If for some reason we didn’t use Vercel, we could also export the site as static (
 30
 npm run export ) and host
 on any static server or Netlify, but features like the Image optimization would require additional setup in
 that case
 . Sticking with Vercel is the smoothest path for Next.js.

Conclusion
 By following this implementation plan, we will transform the KPP presentation into a modern, professional
 web experience. We started by migrating to Next.js, which provides a solid foundation and built-in
 optimizations. We integrated MDX so that slide content can be written in a friendly format while still
 supporting rich interactivity – this will make it easier to maintain the presentation content over time. We
 added interactive charts (using Recharts) to convey data in an engaging way, and handled images/videos
 with Next.js’s optimized approach to preserve media quality without sacrificing performance. 
Critically, we placed a strong emphasis on design consistency and responsiveness: establishing a cohesive
 style guide (colors, fonts, components) that is applied uniformly on every page, so the user experience is
 seamless as one navigates through the site. The introduction of a global NavBar and footer further
 professionalizes the site, making it feel like a complete web portal rather than a set of disjointed pages. All
 interactive elements have been made accessible and we followed best practices (skip links, alt texts, focus
 states) to ensure inclusivity. Performance considerations were woven throughout each step – from
 leveraging Next.js code splitting and image optimization to deploying on a CDN-backed platform – resulting
 in a fast, smooth site (we expect excellent Lighthouse scores for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices,
 and SEO) .

 This step-by-step plan can be executed in phases (as we did in the guide, from setup through deployment
 ). At each phase, you can verify the improvements: e.g., after integrating MDX, confirm you can navigate
 between slide pages; after styling, check that the site looks uniform; after adding accessibility features, run
 an audit. By iteratively building and refining in this way, we mitigate risks and ensure each improvement is
 solid before moving on.
 In the end, implementing these improvements will result in a polished web presentation for KPP technology– one that not only communicates the technical content effectively but does so with modern flair, reliability,
 and professionalism. The developer can proceed with confidence using this plan, and of course, adapt the
 specifics as needed for the project’s exact requirements. Good luck, and happy coding!
